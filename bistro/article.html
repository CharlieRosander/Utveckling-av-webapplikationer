    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new
        cooking technique called <b><dfn>sous vide</dfn></b>. In <i>sous vide</i>
        cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
        in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
        set to the target temperature you want the food
        to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
        Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
        poaching</q>.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <i>sous vide</i> Salmon
        with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
        table, contact us before <time datetime="20231130">November 30</time>.</p>

    <p><small>Warning: <i>sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not
            pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
            immunity issues.</small></p>
